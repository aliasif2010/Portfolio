        I am a 10 year old boy. I like Coding and playing sports.
            In coding I know how to code games and apps. I achieved the game developer and now I am on Web Dev. I used to code on code.org and thunkable. But now I code on brackets which is harder becuase here we type the coding. On thunkable and code.org we use blocks to code.
            I also like playing video games! My favourite video game is probably "Brawl Stars". But I like so much more different games.<br/><br/>
